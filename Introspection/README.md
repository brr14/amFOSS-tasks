I think this club will play an integral part of my life in college since I aim to put maximum effort and contribute to the club.
Since this is a reputable club there will be a lot I can learn from my mentors and the members of the club.I learnt HTML when I was in class 8th and it really intrigued me and then I later on went to learn python in 11th and 12th. I am eager to learn and dedicated to what I do.
# What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I plan to better my coding skills and create projects in the areas where I am interested.I want to learn more and more things in the field I am pursuing which will enable me to hone my skills in this area.
# How would you contribute back to the club?
I am would take active participation in all of the events take place and try to contribute as much as I can .
# Do you have any feedback on the selection process?
This was a little intimidating at start since I was pretty much new to all the concepts used in the given tasks but at the same time it was a great learning experience 
I learned a lot of new and interesting things.All in all it was a very well thought out selection process.
