# My views on the tasks
The tasks were a learning experience. There were many new things that I learned through these tasks. I learned how to construct a website and build an app which was very new to me. It was a liberating experience all in all. The tasks were challenging and that's what makes the club so exclusive and fun to join. It cultivated some self learning and awareness.

# My Introduction
Hi Seniors and batchmates ðŸ‘‹ . I am Pakhi Banchalia from Dehradun, Uttarakhand. I have done programming in school in languages including Java, Python, C++. I got to know about amFOSS during induction programs, and I've wanted to be a part of the club ever since. I feel like joining the club would help me grow academically as well as professionally. It'll give me a great amount of exposure which will further help me in my career. I would love to be a part of this prestigious club.
