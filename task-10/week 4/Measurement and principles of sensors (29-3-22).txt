(I) ABSOLUTE INTRUMENTS
(a) indicate the value of the quantity being measure in terms of constanst
of the instruments and their deflection onli.
(b)The example of such an instrument is tangent galvanometer, which gives the 
value of current, in terms of the tangent of deflection 
produced by the current,the radius and number of turns of wire used and the
 horizontal component of earthâ€™s field.
(c) used in labs 

(II)SECONDARY INSTRUMENTS{used in everday werk}
(a) Indicating- indicates the instantaneous value of the reading
(b) Recording - gives a continuous record of the variation of the quantity 
being measured(v,frequency,P)
used in power plants and process industries.
(c) Integrating- takes into consideration the period or the time over which
 the quantity is supplied eg- 
amperehour meter,energy meter.
Electrical instruments can be classified into:
ac,dc and ac/dc instruments.
{A) Analog - continuos and stepless function of time easy to understand,
calibrate and maintain
(B) Digital- 

SENSORS
*TRANSCUDER
(a)converts a primary form of energy into a corresponding signal w a diff
energy form.(mechanical,thermal)
*SENSOR
(a)a device which provides a usable output in response to a specified 
measurand.
*ACTUATOR
(a)a device that generates a signal or stimulus.

Sensor systems
general electronic sensor
(a)primary tranducer-changes real world parameter into electrical signal
(b)secondray transcuder-converts electrical signal into analog or digital 
signal
(c)conventinal transducer-large,generally stable but based on old tech
eg- thermocouple,compass
(d)microelectronic sensors-millimeter,highly sensitive,less robust
eg-photodiode,piezoresistive pressure sensor,chemical sensors
